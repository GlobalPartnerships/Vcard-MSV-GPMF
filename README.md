# Contacto - Marcela Sánchez Vargas

This project is a simple, visually appealing digital business card (vCard) landing page for Marcela Sánchez Vargas, Co-Founder and Business Development executive at Global Partnerships Multidisciplinary Firm.

## Features

- **Professional Branding**: Displays the firm's colors, logo, and mission.
- **Contact Card**: Includes Marcela Sánchez Vargas's name, title, phone, website, and direct LinkedIn links (both company and personal).
- **Add to Contacts**: 
  - Users can click the "Añadir a contactos" ("Add to contacts") button to instantly download a vCard (`.vcf` file) with Marcela's complete contact information.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly and visually attractive layout.
- **Social Links**: Quick access to LinkedIn (personal and company).

## How it Works

1. **Contact Information Display**:  
   Contact details are shown in a clean card format, styled with custom CSS for a modern, professional look.

2. **vCard Generation & Download**:
   - Pressing the "Añadir a contactos" button runs a script that generates a `.vcf` file with the contact data.
   - The vCard file downloads automatically for easy import into smartphones or address books.
   
3. **Accessibility**:
   - All links open in new tabs.
   - Phone number link works on mobile for easy calling.

## File Structure

- `Vcarg!DOCTYPE.html`: Main HTML file (digital business card with built-in styles and script).
- Images (e.g., `GPMF LOGO v 3.0-03.png`): Logo used at the top of the contact card.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Place the logo image (`GPMF LOGO v 3.0-03.png`) in the same folder as the HTML file.
3. Open `Vcarg!DOCTYPE.html` in a web browser.
4. To add the contact, click the blue "Añadir a contactos" button and import the downloaded `.vcf` file into your device's address book.

## Customization

- Modify contact information directly in the HTML under the `.contact-card` section or adjust the vCard details in the JavaScript.
- To update styles, edit the `<style>` block in the `<head>` section.
